# sentiment-analysis


used python's nltk and sklearn library to do sentiment analysis. Trained it over a set of positive and negative sentences. This was a summer 
practice project. Later it was extended to analysisng sentiments over live twitter feeds and also voice recognized sentiment analysis.
